# 🚀 Project Overview

This project automates the provisioning of AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It sets up an S3 bucket for static website hosting with versioning, public access settings, and automated file uploads. Additionally, it includes configurations for managing Terraform state, variables, and object deletions.

## 📚 Topics Involved

1. **Terraform Basics** ⚙️ – Writing and managing Terraform configuration files to define cloud infrastructure.
2. **AWS S3 Bucket Management** 🪣 – Creating, configuring, and managing Amazon S3 buckets for static website hosting.
3. **S3 Versioning and Ownership Controls** 🔄👑 – Enabling versioning for object storage and managing ownership policies.
4. **Public Access and Website Configuration** 🌐🔓 – Configuring public access settings and defining website behavior for S3-hosted sites.
5. **Terraform Providers and Variables** 🎛️ – Setting up the AWS provider and managing configurations using variables.
6. **State Management and Git Ignore Best Practices** 🛑 – Handling Terraform state files and ensuring proper version control.
7. **Automated File Uploads** 📤 – Using local-exec provisioners to upload content to an S3 bucket.
8. **Object Deletion Management** 🗑️ – Managing file deletions in an S3 bucket using JSON configuration.
9. **Terraform Execution Workflow** 🚀 – Running Terraform commands for initialization, planning, applying, and destroying infrastructure.

## 📂 Files Overview

### 1. `.gitignore` 🛑

- Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git to prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being committed.
- **Terraform State Files:**
  - `terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup` 📜 contain the current state of the infrastructure and backups, which should not be tracked by Git.
  - `tfplan` is a Terraform plan output file used for reviewing changes before applying them.
- **Terraform Working Directory:**
  - `.terraform/` is a local directory containing provider plugins and other Terraform-related metadata.
  - `.terraform.lock.hcl` locks provider versions to ensure consistency and should not be manually modified.
- **Logs and Temporary Files:**
  - `*.log` 📝 ignores all log files generated during Terraform operations.
  - `*.bak` ignores backup files created during state management.

### 2. `main.tf` 🌍

- The primary Terraform configuration file.
- Defines the infrastructure resources and their configurations.
- **Key Resources:**
  - `aws_s3_bucket` (`website`) 🪣: Creates an S3 bucket to host a static website.
  - `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` (`versioning`) 🔄: Enables versioning for the S3 bucket.
  - `aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls` (`ownership`) 👑: Configures ownership settings to ensure the bucket owner has full control.
  - `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` (`public_access`) 🔓: Manages public access settings for the bucket, allowing public access.
  - `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` (`website_config`) 🌐: Configures the bucket to host a static website, defining `index.html` and `error.html` as the main pages.
  - `null_resource` (`upload_files`) 📤: Uses a local-exec provisioner to upload website files from a local directory to the S3 bucket with public read access.
  - `output` (`bucket_name` & `website_url`) 📎: Outputs the S3 bucket name and the website endpoint after deployment.

### 3. `provider.tf` ☁️

- Configures Terraform providers.
- **Key Components:**
  - `terraform` block: Specifies required providers.
  - `required_providers`: Defines the AWS provider, sourced from HashiCorp with a version constraint (`~> 5.0`).
  - `provider` block: Configures the AWS provider and sets the region using the `var.region` variable.

### 4. `variables.tf` 🎛️

- Defines variables used across Terraform configurations.
- **Key Variables:**
  - `region` 📍: Specifies the AWS region where resources will be deployed (default: `us-east-1`).
  - `bucket_name` 🏷️: Defines the name of the S3 bucket to be created (default: `mybucket-unique-name`).

### 5. `terraform.tfvars` 🛠️

- Contains values for the defined variables in `variables.tf`.
- Typically used to manage environment-specific configurations.
- **Key Assignments:**
  - `region = "us-east-1"` 📌: Specifies the AWS region where resources will be deployed.
  - `bucket_name = "unique-bucket-name-1"` 📦: Defines the name of the S3 bucket to be created.

### 6. `delete.json` 🗑️

- A JSON file specifying objects to be deleted from the S3 bucket.
- Contains a list of files and their corresponding version IDs.
- **Key Structure:**
  - `Objects`: A list containing details of files marked for deletion.
  - Each object includes:
    - `Key` 🔑: The file path within the S3 bucket.
    - `VersionId` 🏷️: The version identifier for the specific file.
- **Example Entries:**
  ```json
  {
      "Key": "index.html",
      "VersionId": "QgNQAeeLgDHd40KWgYcCFVeHcT0MtEcw"
  }
  ```
## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have:

- **Terraform installed** ([Install Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli))
- **AWS CLI installed and configured** (`aws configure`)
- **Proper IAM permissions** to create Buckets and manage policies

## 📖 Usage

1. **Clone the Repository** 📂

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/harris-97/S3_static_web_host.git
  cd S3_static_web_host
  ```


2. **Initialize Terraform** ⚙️
```sh
   terraform init
   ```
3. **Validate Configuration** ✅
```sh
   terraform validate
   ```
4. **Plan Infrastructure Changes** 📝
```sh
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   ```

## 🔍 Notes

- Ensure Terraform is installed before running these commands.
- The `.gitignore` file prevents committing sensitive state files.
- Modify `terraform.tfvars` to customize infrastructure parameters.
- `delete.json` can be used to manage file deletions programmatically by referencing specific file versions.
